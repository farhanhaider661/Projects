Fake news prediction using logistic regression is a technique that involves using a logistic regression model to classify news articles as either real or fake based on a set of features. Logistic regression is a popular statistical model used for binary classification tasks, where the output variable can take only two possible values.
Overview of the process:

Dataset: To train a logistic regression model for fake news prediction, you would typically start with a labeled dataset that consists of news articles along with their corresponding labels indicating whether they are real or fake. The dataset needs to be preprocessed to extract relevant features from the articles.

Feature extraction: Various features can be extracted from news articles, such as the frequency of specific words or phrases, the presence of certain entities or topics, sentiment analysis scores, readability measures, and more. These features help capture patterns and characteristics that can distinguish real and fake news.

Training the model: Once the dataset is prepared with the extracted features, the next step is to train a logistic regression model. Logistic regression models the relationship between the features and the binary output variable using a logistic function. The model learns the optimal weights for each feature to make predictions.

Model evaluation: After training the logistic regression model, it needs to be evaluated to assess its performance. This involves splitting the labeled dataset into training and testing subsets. The model is trained on the training subset and then evaluated on the testing subset to measure its accuracy, precision, recall, and other relevant metrics.

Prediction: Once the logistic regression model is trained and evaluated, it can be used to make predictions on new, unseen news articles. The model takes the extracted features from the article as input, computes the probability of the article being fake using the logistic function, and classifies it accordingly.
